<h2><b>My Childhood</b></h2>

<p style="font-size: 115%;">
	I was born and raised in <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=highlands+ranch+colorado&oq=highlands+ranch+col&aqs=chrome.0.0i355i433i512j46i433i512j0i20i263i512j69i57j0i512l6.4336j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">Highlands Ranch, Colorado.</a> I grew up playing a bunch of sports and by the time I was 14, I was only playing hockey. I played hockey my whole life and will continue to play for Creighton's club team. I went to private schools for elementary and middle school, and a public school for high school. I have always done well in school and got some experience in html coding from middle school. <br><br> Hopefully that experience translates in this class and makes things a little easier for me. I also have some experience using Java Script from Codeacademy and a few other random coding languages from doing robotics in Engineering classes.

<h2>Why Creighton</h2>

<table style="border: 2px solid; border-collapse: collapse;">
	<tr>
		<td style="border: 2px solid; font-size: 115%;">Price</td>
		<td style="border: 2px solid; font-size: 115%;">Creighton offered me a good amount of financial aid and scholarship money, making it very reasonable to come here.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="border: 2px solid; font-size: 115%;">Location</td>
		<td style="border: 2px solid; font-size: 115%;">Creighton is a great distance from home for me being an 8 hour drive. Omaha is a nice city with a lot of food and fun <br>places to go, so that also helped in my decision.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="border: 2px solid; font-size: 115%;">Size</td>
		<td style="border: 2px solid; font-size: 115%;">Creighton is the perfect size for me. It is a big enough school where you can meet new people all the time, but also <br>small enough to keep a tight knit community and recieve one on one help.</td>
