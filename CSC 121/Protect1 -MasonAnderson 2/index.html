<h2><b>My Childhood</b></h2>

<p style="font-size: 115%;">
	I was born and raised in <u>Highlands Ranch, Colorado.</u> I grew up playing a bunch of sports and by the time I was 14, I was only playing hockey. I played hockey my whole life and will continue to play for Creighton's club team. I went to private schools for elementary and middle school, and a public school for high school. I have always done well in school and got some experience in html coding from middle school. <br><br> Hopefully that experience translates in this class and makes things a little easier for me. I also have some experience using Java Script from Codeacademy and a few other random coding languages from doing robotics in Engineering classes.

<h2>Why Creighton</h2>

<p style="font-size: 115%">
	I first toured Creighton when I was in Omaha for a hockey tournament. I was a big fan of the campus and the Creighton environment, so I decided to apply. I got in and was offered a good amount of scholarship money and financial aid. After comparing pricing and other aspects of college life to other Universities, I decided Creighton was the school for me. I have been very happy with this decision so far and the environment here is great.
